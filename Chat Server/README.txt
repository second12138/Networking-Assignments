For question 3:

1）The comunication between two clients requires two checks, which means after A indicates it is willing 
to pair B, B also needs to indicates it is willing to pair with A. Then they can comunicate with each other.
  
If there is only one check from A to B, then B will not able to send message to A but rather just receive 
messages from A since B did not indicate it is willing to comunicate with A yet.

2）Assume the cient enter a right name at once. If client entered a worng name, her/she will not able to 
enter a name again.
